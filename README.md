# LSTM-Tutorial-PyTorch
This can be helpful for learning about LSTMs, how to implement them using PyTorch.

I am generating a sinusoidal wave in Python and I want to use LSTM to predict the future samples. I have implemented it in Jupyter Notebook so that it can be executed step wise and one can see the output and if wished its dimensions. Cheers!
